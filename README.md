Connectwise Manage API PowerShell

## Introduction
This module facilitates interaction with the ConnectWise Manage REST API via PowerShell. It is designed to make access simple with picklists and a built-in entity explorer, and also to grow with the ConnectWise Manage API. PickLists and endpoints are dynamically generated from the API JSON file, so updates are fast.
